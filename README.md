# Getting started with Terraform

Contains four files.

1. main.tf - contains all the necessary code to apply changes
2. variables.tf - contains all the variables that are referenced
3. providers.tf - contains all the cloud providers
4. output.tf - contains outputs

To execute,

- run `terraform init` to initialise and download the provider's configurations

- run `terraform plan` to verify changes

- run `terraform apply` to apply changes.
